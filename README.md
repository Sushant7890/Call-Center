# Call-Center
## Project Objective
This is a Call Center Performance Dashboard built using Power BI. It provides an overview of key metrics related to call center operations, including answered and received calls, agent statistics, and customer satisfaction.

## Dataset Used:
- <a href="https://github.com/Sushant7890/Call-Center/blob/main/01%20Call-Center-Dataset.xlsx">DataSet Details</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
-Which agents have the highest and lowest satisfaction scores?         
-Is there a correlation between call resolution rate and satisfaction score?         
-What is the percentage of answered vs. received calls?                
-What is the average speed of answering calls, and how does it vary by agent?            
-How does the number of calls per month fluctuate over time?               
-Which agent has answered the most and least number of calls?                 
-How does the resolution rate compare among different agents?           
-What percentage of calls are resolved successfully?                 
-How many calls are left unanswered, and what impact does it have?

## Process
-Review call volume, response times, and satisfaction scores.                     
-Identify patterns in missed calls, slow response times, and unresolved issues.                  
-Conduct training to improve customer interactions and problem resolution.              
-Set KPIs for call resolution, response time, and satisfaction scores.                       
-ptimize workforce scheduling based on peak call times.             
-Introduce AI chatbots or self-service options to handle basic queries.             
-Use real-time monitoring tools to track agent performance and call handling.

## Project Insight
-The satisfaction score is low (2.76/5), indicating potential customer dissatisfaction.                  
-The call response time averages around 54 seconds, which might impact service quality.               
-Some agents, like Stewart (avg speed: 54.18s) and Becky (53.61s), are answering faster than others.            
-he percentage of answered calls is relatively low, meaning many calls are left unanswered.             

## Conclusion:
The Call Center Dashboard highlights key performance gaps, including a low customer satisfaction score (2.76) and a high call response time (54.74 seconds). A significant portion of calls remain unanswered, impacting overall service quality. While some agents perform better, there is room for improvement in resolution rates and efficiency. To enhance performance, reducing response times, optimizing staffing, and improving customer interactions should be prioritized.
